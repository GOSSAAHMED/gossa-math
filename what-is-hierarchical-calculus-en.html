  <h1>What is Hierarchical Calculus?</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Hierarchical Calculus</strong> is a mathematical framework that extends the concept of differentiation by introducing a structured hierarchy of derivatives.
    Instead of treating all derivatives as a single uniform family, it organizes derivatives using the notions of <strong>rank</strong> and <strong>degree</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Why was it introduced?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Some differential equations appear unsolvable under classical methods.</li>
    <li>Complex systems can involve layered change that classical derivatives cannot separate clearly.</li>
    <li>A richer operator structure can help transform and classify equations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key idea: Rank and Degree</h2>
  <p>
    In hierarchical calculus, a derivative is not only “first” or “second”. It can be characterized by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rank:</strong> the structural layer of differentiation</li>
    <li><strong>Degree:</strong> the intensity/power of the operator within that rank</li>
  </ul>
