<h1>Difference Between the Classical Derivative D₀ and the Relative Derivative D₁</h1>

<p>
In classical calculus, the derivative is understood as a measure of infinitesimal linear change.
However, not all forms of variation are purely linear.
Hierarchical Calculus introduces the <strong>relative derivative D₁</strong> to capture structural change that cannot be described by the classical derivative <strong>D₀</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Although both operators describe variation, they answer fundamentally different mathematical questions.
This page explains the difference between D₀ and D₁ using <em>one carefully chosen example</em>,
allowing the conceptual distinction to appear clearly without unnecessary technical complexity.
</p>

<h2>Quick Summary</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>D₀</strong> measures infinitesimal linear change.</li>
  <li><strong>D₁</strong> measures relative structural change.</li>
  <li>D₀ depends on absolute variation with respect to x.</li>
  <li>D₁ depends on hierarchy through rank and degree.</li>
  <li>The two operators are conceptually different and not interchangeable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conceptual Meaning of the Classical Derivative D₀</h2>

<p>
The classical differential derivative D₀ is defined as the limit of a ratio of infinitesimal differences.
Geometrically, it represents the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point.
Analytically, it measures how fast a function changes with respect to its variable.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation works perfectly when variation is linear and local.
However, D₀ does not encode any notion of hierarchy, scale normalization, or structural level.
All change is treated as absolute.
</p>

<h2>Conceptual Meaning of the Relative Derivative D₁</h2>

<p>
The relative derivative D₁ is defined within the framework of Hierarchical Calculus.
Instead of measuring absolute linear change, D₁ measures variation <em>relative to the structure of the function itself</em>.
</p>

<p>
This requires two independent parameters:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Rank</strong>: determines the hierarchical level at which variation is measured.</li>
  <li><strong>Degree</strong>: controls the intensity of relative variation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because of this structure, D₁ can remain invariant under transformations that would affect D₀.
This property makes D₁ suitable for modeling normalized or scale-independent variation.
</p>

<h2>The Function Used in the Example</h2>

<p>
To compare D₀ and D₁ fairly, we choose a simple function:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <strong>f(x) = x²</strong>, &nbsp; with &nbsp; x &gt; 0
</p>

<p>
This function is smooth, monotonic on the chosen domain, and familiar from classical calculus.
It allows the distinction between the two derivatives to appear without technical distractions.
</p>

<h2>Applying the Classical Derivative D₀</h2>

<p>
Using classical calculus, we compute:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <strong>D₀ f(x) = 2x</strong>
</p>

<p>
This result depends explicitly on x.
At the point x = 2, we obtain:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <strong>D₀ f(2) = 4</strong>
</p>

<p>
This value represents the slope of the tangent line at x = 2.
If x changes, the value of D₀ changes proportionally.
The derivative is therefore sensitive to absolute scale.
</p>

<h2>Applying the Relative Derivative D₁</h2>

<p>
Within Hierarchical Calculus, the relative derivative D₁ is computed using the structural properties of the function.
For rank 1 and degree 1, we obtain:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <strong>D₁ f(x) = 2</strong>
</p>

<p>
Evaluating at x = 2 yields:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <strong>D₁ f(2) = 2</strong>
</p>

<p>
Unlike D₀, this value does not depend on the absolute magnitude of x.
It reflects the internal structural behavior of the function rather than its local slope.
</p>

<h2>Structural Interpretation of the Difference</h2>

<p>
The difference between D₀ and D₁ is not a matter of numerical discrepancy but of interpretation.
D₀ answers the question:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <em>How fast does the function change at this point?</em>
</p>

<p>
D₁ answers a different question:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <em>How does the function vary relative to its own structure?</em>
</p>

<p>
Because these questions are different, the results need not coincide.
This explains why D₁ introduces rank and degree, concepts absent from classical calculus.
</p>

<h2>Why D₀ Cannot Replace D₁</h2>

<p>
No choice of scaling or normalization applied to D₀ can reproduce the hierarchical behavior encoded in D₁.
The classical derivative lacks the structural parameters required to describe relative variation.
</p>

<p>
This is not a limitation of D₀, but a reflection of its intended scope.
Each derivative is valid within its own conceptual domain.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This example demonstrates that the relative derivative D₁ is not an alternative expression of the classical derivative D₀.
It is a distinct mathematical operator designed to capture structural variation within a hierarchical framework.
</p>

<p>
Understanding this distinction is essential for applying Hierarchical Calculus correctly
and for avoiding conceptual confusion between absolute and relative change.
