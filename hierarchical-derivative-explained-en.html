  <h1>Hierarchical Derivative Explained (D0 vs D1)</h1>

  <p>
    In classical calculus we describe derivatives using f′(x), f″(x), and higher orders.
    In <strong>Hierarchical Calculus</strong>, derivatives can be interpreted through layered operators such as <strong>D0</strong> and <strong>D1</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>What does D0 represent?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>D0</strong> can be viewed as the base layer derivative.
    It often behaves closest to classical differentiation and captures the most direct form of variation.
  </p>

  <h2>What does D1 represent?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>D1</strong> represents a higher interpretive layer.
    It may encode structural change, relational change, or a hierarchical transformation of variation beyond the standard slope interpretation.
  </p>

  <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It helps describe multi-layer dynamics (micro vs macro change).</li>
    <li>Two derivatives may look numerically similar but differ in meaning inside equations.</li>
    <li>It enables new equation transformations and classifications.</li>
  </ul>
