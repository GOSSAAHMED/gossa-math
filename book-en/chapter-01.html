      <h2>1.1 Change as the Core of Scientific Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        There is no science without change. Since the earliest attempts to
        understand nature, the fundamental question has always been:
        <strong>How does something change?</strong>
        Motion of bodies, evolution of organisms, growth of economies,
        transfer of energy, and transitions between physical states are
        all manifestations of the same underlying question: what is change?
      </p>
      <p>
        Natural sciences, across all disciplines, are structured efforts
        to measure change, describe it, and predict its behavior.
        Consequently, genuine scientific progress is inseparable from
        the development of precise tools for measuring change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.2 From Qualitative Description to Quantitative Measurement</h2>
      <p>
        In early stages of knowledge, change was described qualitatively:
        faster, hotter, larger. While such descriptions are indispensable,
        they are insufficient for rigorous science.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decisive transition occurred when description was replaced
        by measurement, intuition by number. Mathematics became the
        language of science, culminating in the development of
        differential calculus as a systematic theory of change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.3 The Classical Derivative and Its Historical Success</h2>
      <p>
        The classical derivative
      </p>
      \[
        D_0 y = \frac{dy}{dx}
      \]
      <p>
        represents one of the greatest achievements in mathematics.
        It provides a precise measure of instantaneous change and
        enables the formulation of physical laws, differential equations,
        and mathematical models across science and engineering.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.4 Limits of Absolute Measurement</h2>
      <p>
        Despite its power, the classical derivative measures change
        in an absolute sense: how much \(y\) changes with respect to \(x\),
        without regard to the scale or magnitude of \(y\) itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This raises a fundamental question:
        <strong>Is absolute change sufficient to describe all phenomena?</strong>
        In many real systems, the answer is no.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.5 The Need for Relative Change</h2>
      <p>
        In practice, we are often more interested in how much a quantity
        changes relative to its size. A small variation in a sensitive
        system may be more significant than a large variation in a massive one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such information is invisible to absolute measurement but becomes
        evident through relative change.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.6 From Relative Change to Relative Calculus</h2>
      <p>
        This insight motivates the introduction of a new mathematical tool
        that does not replace classical calculus but extends it.
        This tool is the <strong>relative derivative</strong>,
        denoted in this book by \(D_1\).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.7 Why a Single Level of Measurement Is Not Enough</h2>
      <p>
        Complex systems often exhibit change across multiple layers.
        Relative change itself may vary, and the appropriate scale
        depends on the observational level.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.8 Hierarchy as a Natural Principle</h2>
      <p>
        Hierarchy is a fundamental feature of nature:
        atoms form molecules, molecules form cells, cells form organisms.
        Each level has its own laws, yet remains connected to others.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1.9 From Natural Hierarchy to Hierarchical Calculus</h2>
      <p>
        Hierarchical Calculus is based on a simple principle:
        if phenomena are hierarchical, then the measurement of change
        must also be hierarchical.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>1.10 The Role of This Chapter</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter establishes the conceptual foundation of the book.
        It prepares the reader for the formal definitions and mathematical
        structures developed in the following chapters.
