  <h1>Why Some Differential Equations Are Unsolvable</h1>

  <p>
    Some differential equations appear unsolvable not only because of algebraic difficulty,
    but because the derivative framework itself may be too restrictive for the problem.
  </p>

  <h2>Common reasons classical methods fail</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard transformations do not reduce the equation to solvable forms.</li>
    <li>A solution may not exist in the classical space of functions.</li>
    <li>The derivative interpretation may be incomplete for multi-layer behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hierarchical Calculus perspective</h2>
  <p>
    Hierarchical calculus suggests that some problems require multiple derivative operators (like D0 and D1),
    which can reformulate the equation into a solvable hierarchical form.
